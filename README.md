node modules has express, body-parser, mongoose, concurrently, and nodemon at the moment

client folder is the frontend. everything ourside is backend stuff. 
data base schema models are in the models folder
client>src>components will have the react components

From the project directory (directory that has server.js and the folders) run these commands to start stuff:

**The first time you clone the repo, you need to run npm install, it's configured in a way that will install both the backend/server node modules as well as the frontend/client node modules**

npm start will start the backend server (won't need to use ever)

**npm run server will start the backend server using nodemon so you won't have to restart server when changes are done, just refresh**

**npm run client will start the frontend(client)**

**npm run dev will start both frontend and server (backend)**
