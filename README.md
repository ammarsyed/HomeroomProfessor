# HomeroomProfessor

## Project Description

The purpose of Homeroom Professor was to provide a volunteer service for faculty and professors in college to be able to tutor elementary, middle, and high school students in a variety of different subjects. This service was created in direct response to the COVID-19 pandemic, where many students were forced to work online and away from easy access to conventional tutors and teachers.

 This service can be supplemental to student learning, assist parents and teachers, provide direct interaction between students and college professors, and allow higher education individuals to give back and serve as role models. This unique interaction between professors and K-12 students could also lay the foundation for future connections in college, as well as give more insight into college for the average student. Professors could also be a resource of encouragement to students, so that they may succeed in their subjects in school and potentially pursue a college education, should they desire.

The website has been built with a variety of different features including but not limited to, unique student and professor dashboards, requesting and scheduling appointments, a professor lookup table, an integrated calendar, professor profile pages, and zoom meeting support. Additional features could be incorporated in future versions, and the dashboard layout on the site provides an easy interface to build off of.
